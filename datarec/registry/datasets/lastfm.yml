description: Last.fm dataset provided for the 2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems (HetRec 2011). 
  The full archive contains multiple files (user-friends, tags, etc.), but this
  loader specifically processes the `user_artists.dat` file, which contains
  artists listened to by each user and a corresponding listening count (`weight`).
