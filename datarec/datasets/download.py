"""
Provides utility functions for downloading and decompressing dataset files.

This module contains a set of helper functions used internally by the dataset
builder classes (e.g., `MovieLens1M`, `Yelp_v1`) to handle the fetching of
raw data from web sources and the extraction of various archive formats
like .zip, .gz, .tar, and .7z.

These functions are not typically called directly by the end-user but are
fundamental to the automatic data preparation process of the library.
