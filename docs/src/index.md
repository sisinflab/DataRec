## What is DataRec
DataRec is a Python library that focuses on the data management phase of recommendation systems. It aims to promote standardization, interoperability, and best practices for processing and analyzing recommendation datasets.

### Features
- Dataset Management: Supports reading and writing various data formats and allows dynamic format specification.
- Reference Datasets: Include commonly used recommendation datasets with traceable sources and versioning.
- Filtering Strategies: Implements popular filtering techniques.
- Splitting Strategies: Implements widely used data splitting strategies.
- Data Characteristics Analysis: Enables computing data characteristics that impact recommendation performance.
- Interoperability: Designed to be modular and compatible with existing recommendation frameworks by allowing dataset export in various formats.
